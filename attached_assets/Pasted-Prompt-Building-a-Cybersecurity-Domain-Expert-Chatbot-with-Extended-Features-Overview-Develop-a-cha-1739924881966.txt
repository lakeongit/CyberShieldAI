Prompt: Building a Cybersecurity Domain Expert Chatbot with Extended Features
Overview
Develop a chatbot that serves as a domain expert in cybersecurity, leveraging OpenAI as the primary large language model (LLM. The system should use Postgres as a vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings. It will feature prompt improvement capabilities, conversational memory, and advanced AI-driven functionalities such as document analysis, classification, and tagging.

The solution will include:

An Admin Interface for document management (upload, update, drag-and-drop).
A User-Facing Chat Interface that uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for domain-specific answers.
Comprehensive Documentation published at a /docs endpoint detailing the system’s setup, usage, and maintenance.
The following design elements are derived from the accompanying sketches:

Admin Interface Layout

Tabs/Sections:
Documents (for managing uploads, classification, tagging)
Policies (for storing and updating cybersecurity policies)
Access Control (to manage user roles/permissions)
Functionality:
Drag-and-Drop Uploads of various file types (Markdown, PDF, Text).
AI-Powered Document Processing (analysis, classification, tagging).
Database Updates: Ingest new documents, re-index in the Postgres VectorDB.
Security: Restricted admin interface, separate from the user-facing chat.
Chat Interface Layout

Chat Box with:
Search capability for relevant cybersecurity topics.
Conversational Memory to maintain context across multiple user turns.
Response Generation:
Primary: Use retrieved context from the Postgres VectorDB to generate domain-specific answers.
Fallback: If relevant context is insufficient, rely on OpenAI to generate an answer (still referencing any discovered context).
Prompt Improver: An optional layer that refines user queries for clarity and context before final retrieval or generation.
AI-Powered Analysis:
The chatbot can perform advanced tasks (e.g., summarization, Q&A, classification) on uploaded or existing documents.
Citation/Reference:
All responses include references to the source documents stored in the vector database.
RAG Pipeline

LangChain for building the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline:
Document Ingestion: Markdown, PDF, and Text files are parsed and loaded into the system.
Vectorization: Use an OpenAI or other embedding model to transform documents into vector representations stored in Postgres.
Retrieval: Query the vector database to find relevant documents for a given user query.
Context Injection: Combine the retrieved context with the user query for more accurate LLM responses.
Conversational Memory: Maintain short- or long-term memory of the conversation using LangChain’s memory components.
LangSmith Tracing

Tracing & Debugging: Use LangSmith to capture and visualize the end-to-end query flow. This includes:
Prompt improvement steps.
Retrieval steps (which documents were retrieved).
OpenAI LLM calls and outputs.
Response generation and final answer.
AI-Powered Document Features

Analysis: Summarize or extract insights from large documents.
Classification: Automatically classify documents into cybersecurity categories (e.g., best practices, frameworks, incident response).
Tagging: Assign relevant keywords or tags to each document for better organization and retrieval.
Comprehensive Documentation

Publish a /docs page detailing:
System Architecture: Diagrams explaining the flow from user query to final response.
Installation & Configuration: Steps to set up the system, including environment variables and database setup.
Admin Interface Usage: How to upload, update, classify, and tag documents.
Chat Interface Usage: Explanation of conversational memory, prompt improvement, and fallback mechanisms.
Security & Access Control: How roles and permissions are managed.
Troubleshooting & FAQ: Common issues and solutions, logs/traces using LangSmith, etc.
Technical Requirements
Core Chatbot Stack

OpenAI as the LLM.
Postgres with vector extension (e.g., pgvector) as the vector store.
LangChain for building the RAG pipeline and managing conversational memory.
LangSmith for tracing and debugging.
Admin Interface

Securely accessible only by authorized personnel.
Drag-and-Drop support for uploading Markdown, PDF, and Text files.
Document Processing: Automatic AI-driven analysis, classification, tagging.
Index Management: Automated re-indexing in Postgres VectorDB upon document additions/updates.
Chat Interface

Conversational Memory: Maintain user context across multiple turns.
Prompt Improver: Preprocess user queries to refine or clarify before retrieval.
Answer Generation:
Primary: Query relevant documents from Postgres, inject them into the LLM prompt.
Fallback: Use OpenAI for general answers if not enough relevant context is found.
Citation & Source: Always include references to the source documents in the final answer.
Deployment & Documentation

Provide detailed steps for deploying the system (Docker or cloud environment).
Publish usage guidelines, developer notes, and API references on the /docs page.
Include instructions for setting up environment variables, connecting to the Postgres database, and integrating with the OpenAI API.
Example High-Level Flow
User Query

User enters a question about cybersecurity best practices in the chat.
The prompt improver refines the query for clarity.
Vector Retrieval

The system searches Postgres VectorDB for relevant documents.
If matches are found, these are passed to LangChain to build the context.
LLM Generation

The refined query + retrieved context is sent to OpenAI.
OpenAI returns a domain-specific answer.
Fallback

If no relevant documents are found, rely on OpenAI to provide a more general answer.
The system still attempts to cite any partial or previously known sources if applicable.
Response & Citation

The chatbot returns the final answer, including:
The user’s original question (optionally).
The system’s response.
Document citations from the vector database.
Admin Updates

An admin logs into the separate interface.
Uploads a new PDF on emerging cyber threats via drag-and-drop.
The system processes and classifies the document, tags it, and updates the Postgres vector index.
The updated document is immediately available for retrieval in future user queries.
Key Implementation Steps
Environment Setup

Install and configure Postgres with vector support (e.g., pgvector).
Create necessary tables/schemas for storing documents and embeddings.
Document Ingestion Pipeline

Parse uploaded files (Markdown, PDF, Text).
Generate embeddings using OpenAI’s embedding model.
Store embeddings + metadata in Postgres VectorDB.
Classify and tag documents using an AI model (optionally OpenAI or another classifier).
LangChain RAG Flow

Configure a RetrievalQA or Conversational RetrievalQA chain with:
A Postgres retriever.
Memory components for chat history.
Prompt templates for improved user queries.
LangSmith Integration

Enable tracing to capture query steps, retrieval hits, and LLM calls.
View logs for debugging and performance insights.
User Interface

Build a chat UI that shows:
Chat conversation.
Option to switch or refine the query.
References for each response.
Admin Interface

Provide secure login.
Offer a dashboard with drag-and-drop document upload.
Display classification and tagging results.
Enable manual editing or re-tagging of documents.
Provide logs or summaries of ingestion steps and potential errors.
